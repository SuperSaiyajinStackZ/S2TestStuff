# S2TestStuff
Just some testing stuff related to The Sims GBA / NDS handheld games, i suppose.

## Repository Structure Explanation

- The `Tools` directory contains the main tools i wrote.
    - It has 2 sections; One is ROM (which is like the name says.. for ROM related things), and the other one... SAV (For Savefile related things).
